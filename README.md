Aiming to make some sort of a speedometer for my bike, ideally for indoor use w/ a trainer. I'd like to have an idea of how fast I'm going and how far I go in one session. 

Code and circuit based on : https://maker.pro/arduino/tutorial/how-to-use-a-hall-effect-sensor-with-arduino

using PlatformIO and an arduino Uno for now.
